# Thought Detox Press Kit

## tl;dr:

Work through what's on your mind, with complete peace of mind. Thought Detox's clean, peaceful interface lets you get negative thoughts out of your head, without storing or sending them anywhere.

## What is Thought Detox?

Writing down your negative thoughts and then discarding them can [help you find peace][psychtoday]. Thought Detox is an iPhone app that lets you mindfully work through those most private thoughts, on your most personal device.

Want to see how that mindfulness affects your week? Connect the app to Apple Health to track the time you spend working through negative thoughts. See those mindfulness trends over the past seven days in the app, or add them to your home screen as a widget. Thought Detox even integrates with [Wind Down][winddown], to let you quickly clear your head before bed.

Learn more on the [app website][website] (coming soon!), follow the [Dropped Bits Twitter account][twitter], or [email me][mailto] and I'll be happy to answer your questions.
